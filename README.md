# Generative AI for Chip Design 

## Abstract
GenAI Units In Digital Design Education (GUIDE), is an open courseware repository with runnable Google Colab labs. GUIDE organizes materials as topics, subtopics, and units across LLM-aided Register-Transfer Level (RTL) generation, LLM-aided RTL verification, and LLM-aided hardware security. We describe the repository architecture and the standard unit package: slides, short videos, runnable labs, and related papers, together with recommended metadata and student deliverables so instructors can reuse units and grade them consistently.

## Hierarchical Prompting for LLM-based Hierarchical Verilog Generation
**Key Idea:**  
This tool supports hierarchical Verilog generation for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve. This allows smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces verilig generation time and yields savings on compute costs. This module will detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We will explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts.

## Veritas: Verilog Code Generation from LLM-Generated Conjunctive Normal Form
**Key Idea:**  
Veritas introduces a novel conjunctive normal form (CNF)-guided verilog synthesis methodology. The idea is to have an LLM generate CNF clauses, a format widely used for formal verification and synthesis validation in hardware design. veritas uses it to formally describe the desired circuit functionality. The generated CNF specifications are deterministically converted into Verilog, ensuring correctness by construction.

## PrefixLLM: LLM-aided Verilog Generation for Prefix Adder Circuit Design
**Key Idea:**  
Prefix circuits are fundamental components in digital adders, widely used in digital systems due to their efficiency in calculating carry signals. Synthesizing prefix circuits with minimized area and delay is crucial for enhancing the performance of modern computing systems. PrefixLLM transforms the prefix circuit synthesis task into a structured text generation problem, termed the Structured Prefix Circuit Representation (SPCR), and introduces an iterative framework to automatically and accurately generate valid SPCRs. PrefixLLM further presents a design space exploration (DSE) framework that uses LLMs to iteratively search for area- and delay-optimized prefix circuits.

## LLM-aided Testbench Generation and Bug Detection for Finite-State Machines

A key aspect of chip design is functional testing, which relies on testbenches to evaluate the functionality and coverage of Verilog designs.

## LLM-based Natural Language to SystemVerilog Assertion
**Key Idea:**  
Assertion-based verification is a popular verification technique that involves capturing design intent in a set of assertions that can be used in formal verification or testing-based checking.  However, writing security-centric assertions is a challenging task. This tool helps LLM generate SystemVerilog assertions from natural language input.

## LLMPirate: LLMs for Black-box Hardware IP Piracy
**Key Idea:** LLMs are increasingly adopted in hardware design and verification, but their powerful generative capabilities also create new security risks. One unexplored threat vector is intellectual property (IP) piracy: rewriting hardware designs to evade piracy detection tools. LLMPirate that generates pirated circuit design variations capable of consistently bypassing state-of-the-art detection methods. LLMPirate addresses challenges in integrating LLMs with hardware circuit descriptions, scaling to large designs, and ensuring practical efficiency, resulting in an end-to-end automated pipeline.

## C2HLSC:  LLMs can Bridge the Software-to-Hardware Design Gap
**Key Idea:**  
We present a case study using an LLM to rewrite C code for NIST 800-22 randomness tests, a QuickSort algorithm, and AES-128 into HLS-synthesizable C. The LLM iteratively transforms the C code guided by the system prompt and tool's feedback, implementing functions like streaming data and hardware-specific signals. With the hindsight obtained from the case study, we implement a fully automated framework (C2HLSC) to refactor C code into HLS-compatible formats using LLMs. To tackle complex designs, we implement a preprocessing step that breaks down the hierarchy in order to approach the problem in a divide-and-conquer bottom-up way.

It addresses a long-standing challenge in circuit design automation: automating netlist generation for analog circuits. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of fine-tuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. In this work, we identify key challenges in automated netlist generation and evaluate multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, in addressing them.

## VeriContaminated: Assessing LLM-Driven Verilog Coding for Data Contamination
**Key Idea:**  
We present the first systematic analysis of data contamination in LLM-based Verilog code generation. Using CCD and Min-K% Probability on VerilogEval and RTLLM, we evaluate major models including CodeGen2.5, Mistral 7B, Phi-4 Mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, DeepSeek-Coder, CodeQwen 1.5, and fine-tuned variants RTLCoder and Verigen. Our results expose significant contamination risks, calling into question current benchmark validity. We further discuss mitigation strategies and quality–fairness trade-offs toward more reliable Verilog LLM evaluation.

## SALAD: Systematic Assessment of Machine Unlearning on LLM-Aided Hardware Design
**Key Idea:**  
We present SALAD, the first comprehensive framework for safeguarding LLM-driven hardware design automation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at Verilog code generation, they also introduce data security risks such as benchmark contamination, intellectual property (IP) leakage, and malicious Verilog generation. SALAD employs machine unlearning to selectively remove contaminated datasets, sensitive design artifacts, and harmful code patterns from pre-trained models—without full retraining. Through targeted case studies, we show that unlearning can effectively mitigate security risks while preserving model utility for trustworthy, contamination-free Verilog generation.

## LockForge: Automating Paper-to-Code for Logic Locking with Multi-Agent Reasoning LLMs
**Key Idea:**  
We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment.

## VeriDispatcher: Multi-Model Dispatching through Pre-Inference Difficulty Prediction for RTL Generation Optimization
**Key Idea:**  
Prior work mainly prompts or finetunes a single model. What remains not well studied is how to coordinate multiple different LLMs so they jointly improve RTL quality while also reducing cost, instead of running all models and choosing the best output. We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs.

We also estimate the uncertainty quantification metrics of each prediction for risk-aware decision-making.
